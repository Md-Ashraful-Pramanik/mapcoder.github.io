        <p>Overview of MapCoder. It starts with a retrieval
            agent that generates relevant examples itself, followed by planning, coding, and iterative debugging agents.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Code synthesis, which requires a deep understanding of complex natural language (NL) problem descriptions,
            generation of code instructions for complex algorithms and data structures, and the successful execution of
            comprehensive unit tests, presents a significant challenge. Thus, while large language models (LLMs)
            demonstrate impressive proficiency in natural language processing (NLP), their performance in code
            generation tasks remains limited. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to code generation tasks
            leveraging the multi-agent prompting that uniquely replicates the full cycle of program synthesis as
            observed in human developers. Our framework, <b>MapCoder</b>, consists of four LLM agents specifically
            designed to emulate the stages of this cycle: recalling relevant examples, planning, code generation, and
            debugging. After conducting thorough experiments, with multiple LLMs ablations, and analyses across seven
            challenging competitive problem-solving and program synthesis benchmarks—MapCoder showcases remarkable code
            generation capabilities, achieving their new state-of-the-art (pass@1) results—(<b>HumanEval 93.9%, MBPP
                83.1%, APPS 22.0%, Code-Contests 28.5%, and xCodeEval 45.3%</b>). Moreover, our method consistently
            delivers superior performance across various programming languages and varying problem difficulties.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">MapCoder Overview</h2>
        Our goal is to develop a multi-agent code generation approach for competitive problem-solving. In order to do
        so, our framework, MapCoder, replicates the human programming cycle through four LLM agents - retrieval, plan,
        code, and debug. We devise a pipeline sequence for MapCoder, intelligently cascading the agents in a structured
        way and enhancing each agent's capability by augmenting in-context learning signals from previous agents in the
        pipeline. However, not all the agent responses/outputs are equally useful. Therefore, additionally, MapCoder
        features an adaptive agent traversal schema to interact among corresponding agents dynamically, iteratively
        enhancing the generated code by, for example, fixing bugs, while maximizing the usage of the LLM agents. Here,
        we first discuss the agents (as per the pipeline), their prompts, and interactions, followed by the dynamic
        agent traversal protocol in MapCoder towards code generation for competitive problem-solving.

        <h3 style="display: flex;"><span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">double_arrow</span>Retrieval Agent</h3>
        Our first agent, the <i>Retrieval Agent</i>, recalls past relevant problem-solving instances, akin to human
        memory. It finds k (user-defined) similar problems without manual crafting or external retrieval models.
        Instead, we leverage the LLM agent itself, instructing it to generate such problems.

        <h3 style="display: flex;"><span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">double_arrow</span>Planning Agent</h3>
        The second agent, the <i>Planning Agent</i>, aims to create a step-by-step plan for the original problem. Our
        <i>Planning Agent</i> uses examples and their plans obtained from the retrieval agent to generate plans for the
        original problem. A straightforward approach would be to utilize all examples collectively to generate a single
        target plan. However, not all retrieved examples hold equal utility. Concatenating examples in a random order
        may compromise the LLM's ability to generate accurate planning. 

        <h3 style="display: flex;"><span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">double_arrow</span>Coding Agent</h3>
        Next is the <i>Coding Agent</i>. It takes the problem description, and a plan from the <i>Planning Agent</i> as
        input and translates the corresponding planning into code to solve the problem. During the traversing of agents,
        <i>Coding Agent</i> takes the original problem and one particular plan from the <i>Planning Agent</i>, generates
        the code, and test on sample I/O. If the initial code fails, the agent transfers it to the next agent for
        debugging. Otherwise, predicts that as the final solution.

        <h3 style="display: flex;"><span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">double_arrow</span>Debugging Agent</h3>
        Finally, the <i>Debugging Agent</i> utilizes sample I/O from the problem description to rectify bugs in the
        generated code. Similar to humans cross-checking their plan while fixing bugs, our pipeline supplements the
        <i>Debugging Agent</i> with plans from the <i>Planning Agent</i>. This plan-derived debugging significantly
        enhances bug fixing in MapCoder, underscoring the pivotal roles played by both the <i>Debugging Agent</i> and
        the <i>Planning Agent</i> in the generation process.

        <p>
            Pass@1 results for different approaches. The green texts indicate SOTA results, and the red text is gain over Direct Prompting approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            In simple program synthesis tasks like HumanEval and MBPP we got highest scale of performance (Pass@1) scores. The current state-of-the-art method, Reflexion perform reasonably well, this approach does not generalize across varying datasets depicting a wide variety of problems. Self-reflection techniques enhance GPT-4's performance on HumanEval but result in a 3% decrease on the MBPP dataset. Consequently, even in HumanEval, with GPT-4, our Pass@1 surpasses Reflexion by ~3%. The significance of MapCoder shines through clearly when evaluated in competitive problem-solving contexts. Across datasets such as APPS, xCodeEval, and CodeContests, MapCoder demonstrates substantial enhancements over Direct prompting methods, with improvements of 41.3%, 52.6%, and 132.8% for ChatGPT, and 73.7%, 41.2%, and 135.1% for GPT4, respectively. Notably, the most challenging datasets are APPS and CodeContest, where MapCoder's performance stands out prominently. Importantly, on CodeContest our Pass@1 results match the Pass@5 scores of the concurrent state-of-the-art model AlphaCodium: 28.5% vs. their 29%. Furthermore, our Pass@5 in CodeContest is 35.2% results demonstrate an additional improvement of 12.8% over AlphaCodium.
